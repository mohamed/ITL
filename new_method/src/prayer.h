 This is a "clean-room" implementation that uses simpler but
 approximate methods. This implementation should be easier
 to maintain and debug. However, we need to first to test it
 throughly before replacing the old method. Currently, it
 supports calculating the prayer times and qibla location for
 "normal" latitudes. However, "extreme latitude" methods are
 still missing.
